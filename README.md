# 💻 VibeForge

> A local, multi-agent AI coding environment — where orchestrators, code-generating agents, and human approval blend into one collaborative workflow.

## 🧠 What is VibeForge?

**VibeForge** is a **local agent orchestration system** for coding. It lets you:

- Run multiple local LLM agents (e.g., CodeBot, RefactorBot).
- Use a central Orchestrator AI (`huihui_ai/deepseek-r1-abliterated`) to assign tasks.
- Communicate via structured Markdown and JSON files.
- Require human approval for risky changes.
- Seamlessly integrate with your IDE.

It's your own local AGI software dev team — under your control.
